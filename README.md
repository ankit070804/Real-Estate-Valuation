Real Estate Valuation (Taiwan Housing Dataset)
This project develops a regression model to predict property prices per unit area based on various features such as age, location, and convenience metrics, utilizing the Taiwan Housing Dataset. The goal is to provide accurate property valuations to aid in real estate analysis and decision-making.


To achieve this goal, the project utilizes several key elements:

Dataset: The Taiwan Housing Dataset.
Features: The model considers features such as the age of the house, its location, and convenience metrics. Temporal features like year and month are also extracted from the transaction date.
Modeling: A regression model is trained using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression.
Evaluation Metrics: The model's performance is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the RÂ² score.
Output: The predicted new property values are converted to USD for easier interpretation.
